LMQL allows you to easily and efficiently query large language models and retrieve the information you need. With LMQL, you can specify the input text, the output format, and the model you want to use , all in a single query. This makes it easy to integrate LLMs into your applications and workflows, and to get the most out of these powerful language models. Additionally, LMQL provides a standardized way of interacting with LLMs, which makes it easier for developers and data scientists to collaborate and share their work .</span></span></div>"
