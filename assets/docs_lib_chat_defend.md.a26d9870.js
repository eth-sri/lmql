Malicious users may leverage these to make your chat application act in unexpected ways or even reveal otherwise hidden information from the system prompt.</p><p>While in general, you should be very careful about what you put in your system prompt, there are some things you can do to mitigate the risk of prompt injections.

These models map sentences to a vector space in which similar sentences are close to each other. We can use this to check whether a user input is similar to a set of disallowed inputs:</p><div class="language-python vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">python</span><pre class="hljs"><code><span class="line"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> numpy <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> np

</span></code></pre></div><p>To run this program, make sure the <code>is_disallowed</code> function is also included in your program code.</p><p>Even though the system prompt explicitly instructs the model to reveal the hidden phrase, if asked for, the model will not do so. This is because <em>disallowed</em> inputs as detected by our sanitization function, are replaced with boilerplate text, which means the model never sees the original, malicious user message.</p><p><strong>Extending the Scope</strong> The set of disallowed phrases can easily be extended by additional examples, while checking for similarity is typically quite cheap even on CPU-only systems. This makes this approach a good candidate for a simple, yet effective defense against prompt injections.</p><p><strong>Other Uses</strong> Apart from checking for malicious user input, the same method can also be used to detect other types of user input. For example, we can check whether the user input relates to one of the topics we want to support and if not, replace it with a default message to prevent the model from going off-topic.</p><h2 id="summary" tabindex="-1">Summary <a class="header-anchor" href="#summary" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Summary&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This chapter showed how to implement a simple embedding-based prompt injection defense. The defense works by checking whether the user input is similar to a set of disallowed inputs. If so, the user input is replaced with default instructions, making sure the model gracefully handles the situation, without actually revealing any information.</p><p>We note that this defense is not perfect and can be circumvented by a sufficiently motivated attacker. However, it is a simple and effective way to prevent prompt injections and can be easily extended to cover more cases or to detect other types of user input.</p>`,18),o=[i];function r(l,p,c,d,h,u){return s(),a("div",null,o)}const y=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,y as default};
