Welcome to LMQL!
===================================

**LMQL** (Language Model Query Language) is a programming language for large language model interaction. 
It facilitates LLM interaction by combining the benefits of natural language prompting with the expressiveness 
of Python. With only a few lines of LMQL code, users can express advanced, multi-part and tool-augmented LM queries, 
which then are optimized by the LMQL runtime to run efficiently as part of the LM decoding loop.

LMQL is a research project by the `Secure, Reliable, and Intelligent Systems Lab <https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/>`_ at ETH Zürich.
